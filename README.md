# Notes

This is my test task which i had to do in a one week.

In this app, I used MVC architectural pattern and CoreData as local storage framework. All UI was made without storyboards by using SnapKit.

Also you can delete note by trailingSwipeAction.

As well connected swiftLint for more readable code.
